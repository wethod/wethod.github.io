      <description>Overview Here&amp;rsquo;s the list of all your employees&amp;rsquo; salary for the current year.
Each Employee has at least a segment which represents a work contract between that employee and the company. Every segment has:
 Start month
 End month
 Gross monthly salary
 Taxes
  You can access the segments for a specific employee just by clicking on the employee&amp;rsquo;s row. Each time you edit a list of the segments, this influences the employee&amp;rsquo;s salary distribution: a line where all segments are visually represented, allowing you to quickly understand how many times the salary of an employee is changed during the year.</description>
