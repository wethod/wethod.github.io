      <description>Overview The budget is where you can list all the resources you think you&amp;rsquo;ll need for the project.
 Basically, this is the place where you define (for a project):
 How many people you need; Which experience levelsÂ you need; Which tasks are needed to get the job done; Who will do what; The external costs; The selling price.  Done? Now the budget must be approved by a supervisor and, once approved, the project manager can start planning and creating orders.</description>
