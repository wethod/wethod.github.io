			<h1>Reports </h1>
			
			

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>All the data you insert in WETHOD are used to generate, weekly and automatically, a set of reports useful to monitor the projects&rsquo; progress.</p>

<h2 id="project-report">Project Report</h2>

<p>Each Monday, utilising data provided by <a href="https://support.wethod.com/friday/index/#timesheet">Timesheet</a>, <a href="https://support.wethod.com/friday/index/#project-status">Project Status</a> and <a href="https://support.wethod.com/budget/index/">Budget</a>, a Project Report is automatically created.</p>

<h3 id="budget-consumption-project-status">Budget Consumption / Project Status</h3>

<p>This section shows the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#budget-consumption">budget consumption</a> of the project, compared to its <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#absolute-project-progress">progress</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the project is <strong>above the diagonal</strong>: it&rsquo;s using a lot of days but it&rsquo;s progressing slowly than predictions based on budget;</li>
<li>If the project is <strong>under the diagonal</strong>: it&rsquo;s using few days but it&rsquo;s progressing faster than predictions based on budget;</li>
<li>If the project is <strong>on the diagonal</strong>: it&rsquo;s planned and managed correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>By analizing the saved budget versions for the project, WETHOD can shows you:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>baseline</strong> which answers the question &ldquo;<em>what would the situation be if I hadn&rsquo;t changed the budget since its first version</em>?&ldquo;;</li>
<li>The <strong>forecast</strong> which answers the question <em>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the situation right now?&rdquo;</em>;</li>
<li>The <strong>projected</strong> which answers the question &ldquo;<em>what will be the situation at the end of the project with the current budget consumption?&rdquo;</em>;</li>
<li>The <strong>wasted</strong> which answers the question &ldquo;<em>what&rsquo;s the situation right now,</em> <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#wasted-hours"><em>wasted hours</em></a> <em>included?&rdquo;</em>;</li>
</ul>

<p>The grey dots shows you the forecast of the various past budget versions.</p>

<p>On the right of the graph you have:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Baseline</strong>: the first budget&rsquo;s hours amount;</li>
<li>The variations of the budget&rsquo;s hours amount since the baseline was approved;</li>
<li><a href="https://support.wethod.com/budget/index/#the-price-s-detail"><strong>Contingency</strong></a>;</li>
<li><strong>Forecast</strong>: the current budget&rsquo;s hours amount (Baseline + variations + contingency);</li>
<li>A resume of the worked, planned, wasted and still available hours.</li>
</ol>

<img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2017/06/12/report-bc_ps.png" class="figure--center"></img>

<h3 id="invoices-orders">Invoices &amp; Orders</h3>

<p>Here are listed all the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/finance/index/#orders">orders</a> and <a href="https://support.wethod.com/finance/index/#invoices">invoices</a> linked to the project, clicking on one of them will take you to the related details.</p>

<h3 id="economics">Economics</h3>

<p>Here is shown the trend of various <a href="https://support.wethod.com/budget/index/">budget&rsquo;s</a> voices for the project:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Revenues</strong>: the project&rsquo;s final net price</li>
<li><strong>Internal Cost</strong>: budget&rsquo;s hours cost</li>
<li><strong>External Cost</strong>: the sum of all budget&rsquo;s external costs, travels and expenses excluded</li>
<li><strong>Travels</strong>: external costs related to &ldquo;Travels&rdquo; budget&rsquo;s task</li>
<li><strong>Expenses</strong>: external costs related to &ldquo;Expenses&rdquo; budget&rsquo;s task</li>
<li><strong>Gross Margin</strong>: the difference between final net price and costs (either internal and external)</li>
<li><strong>Wasted</strong>: the wasted money, which is the sum of the wasted hours multiplied by the cost of their <a href="https://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#company">levels</a></li>
<li><strong>Net Margin</strong>: the difference between gross margin and wasted</li>
</ul>

<p>For each indicator you can see its value for:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>baseline</strong>: first approved budget&rsquo;s version &amp; current progress</li>
<li>The <strong>forecasts</strong>: last approved budget&rsquo;s version (a.k.a. current version) &amp; current progress</li>
<li>The <strong>projected</strong>: last approved budget&rsquo;s version &amp; progress at 100%. Here <strong>internal cost</strong> comes from compiled timesheets</li>
<li>The <strong>delta vs baseline</strong>: difference between projected and baseline, this tells you how the project would be if you had not changed the first budget version</li>
<li>The <strong>delta vs forecast</strong>: difference between projected and forecast, this gives you an idea of how the project will end if you stick to the current budget version</li>
</ul>

<p>The grey percentage under <em>margin</em> can be read as margin against revenues.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><strong>If project is over, projected external costs comes from sent orders and projected travels comes from</strong>  <a href="https://support.wethod.com/finance/index/#travels"><strong>travels</strong></a><strong>&rsquo;s costs</strong></p>

<h3 id="groupwide-economics">Groupwide Economics</h3>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This section is available only for companies in a Group</p>
</div>

<p>The groupwide economics section shows the economics of a project and all its <a href="https://support.wethod.com/pipeline/index/##intercompany-projects">intercompanies</a>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use an example where the company A is the &ldquo;master&rdquo; company and the company B is the supplier (the same can be applied to multiple suppliers).</p>

<li>As of Project Status: final net price of last budget of A based on project status percentages</li>
<li>Projected: final net price of the last approved budget of A</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="roadrunner-index-days-left-worked-hours">Roadrunner Index - Days Left - Worked Hours</h3>

<p>This three charts let you appreciate the trend of three primary indexes related with the project&rsquo;s progress:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Days Left</strong>: data from the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/friday/index/#project-status">Project Status</a> are transposed into this chart to better highlight the weekly progress of the project;</li>
<li><strong>Worked Hours</strong>: data from the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/friday/index/#timesheet">Timesheet</a> are used into this chart to visualize the weekly amount of work spent on the project;</li>
<li><strong>Roadrunner Index</strong>: combining data from the two previous charts let us display the weekly <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#roadrunner-index-rri"><strong>Roadrunner Index</strong></a> for the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the only place in WETHOD where you can see the weekly details of a given project.</p>

<p>When worked hours grows, days left must decrease. If this doesn&rsquo;t happen, you have a problem: your teammates are working on something which doesn&rsquo;t move forward and this is highlited by a Roadrunner Index which differs from the ideal value of 1.</p>

<h3 id="hour-user">Hour / User</h3>

<p>Here are reported, for each teammate who has worked on the project, the comparison between his/her worked hours and his/her planned hours.</p>

<p>Below &ldquo;As of last Friday&rdquo; you can see all the worked and planned hours until last Friday.</p>

<p>Clicking on the calendar icon you can select a custom period and based on the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#company">type of timesheet</a> they are using two behavior are in place:</p>

<ul>
<li>Detailed timesheet: the exact dates chosen in the time range are used to filter results, both for worked and planned hours.</li>
<li>Non-detailed timesheet: the entire week of the start and end dates are considered while fetching data. This applies to both worked and planned hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="consumption-vs-status">Consumption vs Status</h2>

<p>This is an overview of all Projects in terms of resources and time spent on the project, allowing you to analyse their health at a glance.</p>

<p>For each pipeline&rsquo;s project, its <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#budget-consumption">budget consumption</a> is compared to its <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#absolute-project-progress">progress</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the project is <strong>above the diagonal</strong>: it&rsquo;s using a lot of days but it&rsquo;s progressing slowly than predictions based on budget;</li>
<li>If the project is <strong>under the diagonal</strong>: it&rsquo;s using few days but it&rsquo;s progressing faster than predictions based on budget;</li>
<li>If the project is <strong>on the diagonal</strong>: it&rsquo;s planned and managed correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using filters, you can select the Projects you want to see and explore details such as billed hours, invoiced totals, and internal and external purchase orders.</p>

<p>Projects with a <a href="https://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#company">Job Order Category</a> with flag &ldquo;UNLIMITED PLANNING&rdquo; enabled are hidden from this chart because it makes no sense to calculate the budget consumption of a project with unlimited available days.</p>

<h2 id="invoiced-vs-status">Invoiced vs Status</h2>

<p>This report compares the projects&rsquo; status with the percentage of their value which is already been invoiced.</p>

<p>How to read the project&rsquo;s position on the graph:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the project is <strong>above the diagonal</strong>: more work days than the actually done have been invoiced;</li>
<li>If the project is <strong>under the diagonal</strong>: not al work days done for the project have been invoiced;</li>
<li>If the project is <strong>on the diagonal</strong>: project status and invoiced percentage are consistent, this means that until now all the work days done has been invoiced.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="production-value">Production Value</h2>

<p>Here you can find an overview of the annual projects&rsquo; <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#production-value">production value</a>. Each month is displayed as a two overlapped columns:</p>

<ul>
<li>The brilliant-green area (the lower one) represents the production value weighted on the projects&rsquo; probability. So, if a project has got a production value of 100 K but a probability of 90%, it concurs with 90 K to the month&rsquo;s weighted production value</li>
<li>The opaque-green area (the higher one) represents the gross production value that is, basically, a non weighted production value. So each project concurs with the 100% of its production value</li>
</ul>

<p>Above the production value&rsquo;s chart there&rsquo;s the monthly <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#roadrunner-index-rri">Roadrunner Index</a> which aggregates the pipeline&rsquo;s projects&rsquo; Roadrunner Indexes by month.</p>

<ul>
<li>The production target, as set in <a href="https://support.wethod.com/profit-loss/index/#overview">Profit&amp;Loss Budget Target</a></li>
<li>The amount of weeks remaining until the end of the year (the grey area shows the percentage of the year gone )</li>
<li>The yearly weighted production value, by clicking on this area you can access the details about the yearly production value grouped <strong>by client</strong>, <strong>by project</strong> or <strong>by week</strong></li>
<li>The yearly gross production value</li>
</ul>

<p>By clicking on a specific month you can access that month&rsquo;s production value grouped <strong>by client</strong>, <strong>by project</strong> or <strong>by week</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#roadrunner-index-rri">roadrunner index</a>;</li>
<li>The <strong>lost production</strong>: let&rsquo;s say people worked on a project for <em>A</em> hours and the project progressed of <em>B</em> hours. If <em>A</em> is greater than <em>B</em>  you&rsquo;ve used more hours than expected and this value gives you how much production you&rsquo;ve lost;</li>
<li>The <strong>production value</strong>;</li>
<li>The <strong>worked days</strong>: how many days people have worked on the project during the selected week;</li>
<li>The <strong>progress</strong>: how many days the project has progressed during the selected week, that is the difference between the selected week project status and the previous one;</li>
<li>The <strong>1D Value</strong> <strong>(Budget)</strong>: estimated daily production value, that is &ldquo;what is the expected value that must be produced for the project by day?&rdquo;. This is calculated by dividing the project&rsquo;s estimate by the project&rsquo;s budget days;</li>
<li>The <strong>1D Value (Actual)</strong>: actual daily production value, that is &ldquo;what is the value produced for the project by day?&rdquo;. This is calculated by dividing the project&rsquo;s production value by the project&rsquo;s worked days. This value is green if it&rsquo;s greater than <em>1D Value (Budget)</em>, red otherwise;</li>
<li>The <strong>external cost</strong>: project&rsquo;s external cost percentage on the total estimate. This is the same for each week of the projectg</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Projects</strong>: Represents the number of projects for which the user has received a review, according to the selected criterion.</li>

<h2 id="time-off-manager">Time-off Manager</h2>

<p>Particular job order categories may be used to represent <strong>time off</strong>, that are hours spent out of work. Time off can come in different flavors:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vacation</strong>: the annual and usually paid time you get off work</li>
<li><strong>Leave</strong>: refers to time when you can go away from your job</li>
<li><strong>General</strong> if it does not need to be tracked in special ways</li>
</ul>

<p>Differences between &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; and &ldquo;leave&rdquo; time off are probably meaningful only in Italy where they&rsquo;re legally distinct items.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time-off manager&rdquo; section is where you can manage vacation and leave time off for each user.</p>
