			<h1>Reports </h1>
			
			

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>All the data you insert in WETHOD are used to generate, weekly and automatically, a set of reports useful to monitor the projects&rsquo; progress.</p>

<h2 id="project-report">Project Report</h2>

<p>Each Monday, utilising data provided by <a href="https://support.wethod.com/friday/index/#timesheet">Timesheet</a>, <a href="https://support.wethod.com/friday/index/#project-status">Project Status</a> and <a href="https://support.wethod.com/budget/index">Budget</a>, a Project Report is automatically created.</p>

<h3 id="budget-consumption-project-status">Budget Consumption / Project Status</h3>

<p>This section shows the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#budget-consumption">budget consumption</a> of the project, compared to its <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#absolute-project-progress">progress</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the project is <strong>above the diagonal</strong>: it&rsquo;s using a lot of days but it&rsquo;s progressing slowly than predictions based on budget;</li>
<li>If the project is <strong>under the diagonal</strong>: it&rsquo;s using few days but it&rsquo;s progressing faster than predictions based on budget;</li>
<li>If the project is <strong>on the diagonal</strong>: it&rsquo;s planned and managed correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>By analyzing the saved budget versions for the project, WETHOD can shows you:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>baseline</strong> which answers the question &ldquo;<em>what would the situation be if I hadn&rsquo;t changed the budget since its first version</em>?&ldquo;;</li>
<li>The <strong>forecast</strong> which answers the question <em>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the situation right now?&rdquo;</em>;</li>
<li>The <strong>projected</strong> which answers the question &ldquo;<em>what will be the situation at the end of the project with the current budget consumption?&rdquo;</em>;</li>
<li>The <strong>wasted</strong> which answers the question &ldquo;<em>what&rsquo;s the situation right now,</em> <em><a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#wasted-hours">wasted hours</a></em> <em>included?&rdquo;</em>;</li>
</ul>

<p>The grey dots shows you the forecast of the various past budget versions.</p>

<p>On the right of the graph you have:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Baseline</strong>: the first budget&rsquo;s hours amount;</li>
<li>The variations of the budget&rsquo;s hours amount since the baseline was approved;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.wethod.com/budget/index/#the-price-s-detail">Contingency</a></strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Forecast</strong>: the current budget&rsquo;s hours amount (Baseline + variations + contingency);</li>
<li>A resume of the worked, planned, wasted and still available hours.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2017/06/12/report-bc_ps.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="invoices-orders">Invoices &amp; Orders</h3>

<p>Here are listed all the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/finance/index/#orders">orders</a> and <a href="https://support.wethod.com/finance/index/#invoices">invoices</a> linked to the project, clicking on one of them will take you to the related details.</p>

<h3 id="economics">Economics</h3>

<p>Here is shown the trend of various <a href="https://support.wethod.com/budget/index">budget&rsquo;s</a> voices for the project:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Revenues</strong>: the project&rsquo;s final net price</li>
<li><strong>External Cost</strong>: the sum of all budget&rsquo;s external costs (travels, expenses and intercompany costs) excluded</li>
<li><strong>Intercompany Cost</strong>: the sum of the external costs of all intercompany tasks in the budget (this value is only shown if there are intercompany cost tasks)</li>
<li><strong>Travels</strong>: external costs related to &ldquo;Travels&rdquo; budget&rsquo;s task</li>
<li><strong>Expenses</strong>: external costs related to &ldquo;Expenses&rdquo; budget&rsquo;s task</li>
<li><strong>Gross Margin</strong>: final net price without external cost, travels and expenses</li>
<li><strong>Internal Cost</strong>: budget&rsquo;s hours cost</li>
<li><strong>Contribution Margin</strong>: gross margin without internal cost. This value tells you how much a project is able to cover fixed costs</li>
<li><strong>Wasted</strong>: the &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; money, which is the sum of the wasted hours multiplied by the cost of their <a href="https://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#company">levels</a></li>
<li><strong>Net Contribution Margin</strong>: the difference between contribution margin and wasted</li>
</ul>

<p>For each indicator you can see its value for:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>baseline</strong>: first approved budget&rsquo;s version &amp; current progress</li>
<li>The <strong>forecasts</strong>: last approved budget&rsquo;s version (a.k.a. current version) &amp; current progress</li>
<li>The <strong>projected</strong>: last approved budget&rsquo;s version &amp; progress at 100%. Here <strong>internal cost</strong> comes from compiled timesheets</li>
<li>The <strong>delta vs baseline</strong>: difference between projected and baseline, this tells you how the project would be if you had not changed the first budget version</li>
<li>The <strong>delta vs forecast</strong>: difference between projected and forecast, this gives you an idea of how the project will end if you stick to the current budget version</li>
</ul>

<p>The grey percentage under <em>margin</em> can be read as margin against revenues.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><strong>If project is over, projected external costs comes from sent orders and projected travels comes from</strong>  <strong><a href="https://support.wethod.com/finance/index/#travels">travels</a>&rsquo;s costs</strong></p>
</div>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/economics-with-intercompany.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="roadrunner-index-days-left-worked-hours">Roadrunner Index - Days Left - Worked Hours</h3>

<p>This three charts let you appreciate the trend of three primary indexes related with the project&rsquo;s progress:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Days Left</strong>: data from the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/friday/index/#project-status">Project Status</a> are transposed into this chart to better highlight the weekly progress of the project;</li>
<li><strong>Worked Hours</strong>: data from the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/friday/index/#timesheet">Timesheet</a> are used into this chart to visualize the weekly amount of work spent on the project;</li>
<li><strong>Roadrunner Index</strong>: combining data from the two previous charts let us display the weekly <strong><a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#roadrunner-index-rri">Roadrunner Index</a></strong> for the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the only place in WETHOD where you can see the weekly details of a given project.</p>

<p>When worked hours grows, days left must decrease. If this doesn&rsquo;t happen, you have a problem: your teammates are working on something which doesn&rsquo;t move forward and this is highlighted by a Roadrunner Index which differs from the ideal value of 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2018/02/22/project-report.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Need a more detailed view? Just click and drag on a chart to include the area you want to zoom.</p>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2018/02/23/rri-zoom.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="hour-user">Hour / User</h3>

<p>Here are reported, for each teammate who has worked on the project, the comparison between his/her worked hours and his/her planned hours.</p>

<p>Below &ldquo;As of last Friday&rdquo; you can see all the worked and planned hours until last Friday.</p>

<p>Clicking on the calendar icon you can select a custom period and based on the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#company">type of timesheet</a> they are using two behavior are in place:</p>

<ul>
<li>Detailed timesheet: the exact dates chosen in the time range are used to filter results, both for worked and planned hours.</li>
<li>Non-detailed timesheet: the entire week of the start and end dates are considered while fetching data. This applies to both worked and planned hours.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2021/03/25/report-hours-users.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="consumption-vs-status">Consumption vs Status</h2>

<p>This is an overview of all Projects in terms of resources and time spent on the project, allowing you to analyse their health at a glance.</p>

<p>For each pipeline&rsquo;s project, its <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#budget-consumption">budget consumption</a> is compared to its <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#absolute-project-progress">progress</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the project is <strong>above the diagonal</strong>: it&rsquo;s using a lot of days but it&rsquo;s progressing slowly than predictions based on budget;</li>
<li>If the project is <strong>under the diagonal</strong>: it&rsquo;s using few days but it&rsquo;s progressing faster than predictions based on budget;</li>
<li>If the project is <strong>on the diagonal</strong>: it&rsquo;s planned and managed correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using filters, you can select the Projects you want to see and explore details such as billed hours, invoiced totals, and internal and external purchase orders.</p>

<p>Projects with a <a href="https://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#company">Job Order Category</a> with flag &ldquo;UNLIMITED PLANNING&rdquo; enabled are hidden from this chart because it makes no sense to calculate the budget consumption of a project with unlimited available days.</p>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2017/08/28/Budg-consumption-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="invoiced-vs-status">Invoiced vs Status</h2>

<p>This report compares the projects&rsquo; status with the percentage of their value which is already been invoiced.</p>

<p>How to read the project&rsquo;s position on the graph:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the project is <strong>above the diagonal</strong>: more work days than the actually done have been invoiced;</li>
<li>If the project is <strong>under the diagonal</strong>: not al work days done for the project have been invoiced;</li>
<li>If the project is <strong>on the diagonal</strong>: project status and invoiced percentage are consistent, this means that until now all the work days done has been invoiced.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2017/08/28/Revenue_Progress.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="sales-pipeline">Sales Pipeline</h2>

<p>This report is composed by four sections which aggregate the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#revenue-pipeline">revenue pipeline</a> <strong>by probability</strong>, <strong>by client</strong>, <strong>by project type</strong>, <strong>by project type&rsquo;s group</strong> or <strong>by metadata</strong>.</p>

<p>Each section shows a column diagram, where each column refers to a particular year (previous, current, next) and its generated by the projects which invoice plan hits that year. Clicking on a column will show a right panel with further information linked to the column itself.</p>

<p>A different kind of report is the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/reports/index/#budget-breakdown">budget breakdown</a> which shows the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/profit-loss/index/#">company budget</a> compared to the projected <a href="https://support.wethod.com/revenues/index/#">revenues</a> for the current year. The projected revenues are divided into production coming form the projects in pipeline, revenues bluesky and the remaining <a href="https://support.wethod.com/revenues/index/#">delta revenue target</a>.</p>

<h3 id="budget-breakdown">Budget Breakdown</h3>

<p>Clicking on the sub column representing bluesky or delta revenue target will show a panel
listing all the grouped clients with their:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name;</li>

<h2 id="revenues">Revenues 🆕</h2>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This is the first release of a new, broader section dedicated to reports within wethod. We are updating the documentation as we roll out new features to ensure you have complete support. Please note that this section is evolving, with new features to be added over time to enhance your management and analysis experience.</p>
</div>

<p>To view this section, you must have the “view” permission for “Charts.” You can check this in the Permissions section.</p>

<p>In this section, you can create charts related to your company’s revenues.</p>

<p>The first time you access this section, you will find:</p>

<ul>
<li>The “Revenues” chart, showing the current year&rsquo;s revenues, divided by month and grouped by probability cluster. This chart cannot be edited or deleted.</li>
<li>The “Revenues by Client” chart, which is a child of the “Revenues” chart, showing the top 10 most profitable clients. This chart cannot be edited or deleted.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/chart-revenues-default.png" alt="" /><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/chart-revenues-by-client.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each chart can have child charts that inherit the filters applied to the parent.</p>

<p>Each chart also has a child table that shows detailed information about the projects included in the parent chart.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-new-chart">Creating a new chart</h3>

<p>To create a new chart, you must have the “edit” permission for “Charts.” You can check this in the Permissions section.</p>

<p>By clicking the “Add chart” button, you will be prompted to enter some information about the chart you want to create:</p>

<ol>
<li>Chart info: chart name and a brief description</li>
<li>Data segment: filters to apply to limit the data to be considered</li>
<li>Type of chart: the type of chart to use for data visualization</li>
<li>Dimensions: values to assign to each chart dimension. For example, if you’ve selected a Bar Chart, you will need to specify which values to display on the chart’s x and y axes.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/chart-create.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="editing-a-chart">Editing a chart</h3>

<p>To edit an existing chart, you must have the “edit” permission for “Charts.” You can check this in the Permissions section.</p>

<p>You can then click the “Edit chart” button to modify the selected chart.</p>

<h3 id="deleting-a-chart">Deleting a chart</h3>

<p>To delete a chart, you must have the “edit” permission for “Charts.” You can check this in the Permissions section.</p>

<p>You can click the three dots next to the chart’s name to access the option to delete it.</p>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/chart-delete.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="click-to-filter">Click to filter</h3>

<p>You can click on a point in a chart to use it as a filter for child charts and child tables. For example, if you click on a point in the “Revenues” chart that groups all revenues for December related to projects with a 90% probability, the child charts will be filtered to show only the points related to December with a 90% probability.</p>

<h2 id="gross-margin">Gross Margin 🆕</h2>

<p>We’ve introduced a new dimension, “Gross Margin,” which uses data from the “Total” row in this section of the table: <a href="https://support.wethod.com/profit-loss/index/#overview">Economics</a>.</p>

<p>The data segment filters and dimensions are consistent with those in the “Revenues” section. However, the only numeric dimension here will be “Gross Margin” (instead of “Revenues”).</p>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/Screenshot 2024-11-29 alle 12.11.09.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each chart can have child charts that inherit the filters applied to the parent.</p>

<p>Each chart also has a child table that shows detailed information about the projects included in the parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/gross margin 2.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="production-value">Production Value</h2>

<p>Here you can find an overview of the annual projects&rsquo; <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#production-value">production value</a>. Each month is displayed as a two overlapped columns:</p>

<ul>
<li>The brilliant-green area (the lower one) represents the production value weighted on the projects&rsquo; probability. So, if a project has got a production value of 100 K but a probability of 90%, it concurs with 90 K to the month&rsquo;s weighted production value</li>
<li>The opaque-green area (the higher one) represents the gross production value that is, basically, a non weighted production value. So each project concurs with the 100% of its production value</li>
</ul>

<p>Above the production value&rsquo;s chart there&rsquo;s the monthly <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#roadrunner-index-rri">Roadrunner Index</a> which aggregates the pipeline&rsquo;s projects&rsquo; Roadrunner Indexes by month.</p>

<p>On the right you can see the <strong>Revenue Clock</strong> which tells you:</p>

<ul>
<li>The production target, as set in <a href="https://support.wethod.com/profit-loss/index/#overview">Profit&amp;Loss Budget Target</a></li>
<li>The amount of weeks remaining until the end of the year (the grey area shows the percentage of the year gone )</li>
<li>The yearly weighted production value, by clicking on this area you can access the details about the yearly production value grouped <strong>by client</strong>, <strong>by project</strong> or <strong>by week</strong></li>
<li>The yearly gross production value</li>
<li>The part in opacity represents the total value of opportunities (with less than 90% of probability to be won), meanwhile the full colored represents all won project&rsquo;s total value (with 90% of probability or more).</li>
</ul>

<p>By clicking on a specific month you can access that month&rsquo;s production value grouped <strong>by client</strong>, <strong>by project</strong> or <strong>by week</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2018/02/23/production-value-report.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="by-week">By Week</h3>

<p>In this view you can see, for each project (and for the selected week):</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#roadrunner-index-rri">roadrunner index</a>;</li>
<li>The <strong>lost production</strong>: let&rsquo;s say people worked on a project for <em>A</em> hours and the project progressed of <em>B</em> hours. If <em>A</em> is greater than <em>B</em>  you&rsquo;ve used more hours than expected and this value gives you how much production you&rsquo;ve lost;</li>
<li>The <strong>production value</strong>;</li>
<li>The <strong>worked days</strong>: how many days people have worked on the project during the selected week;</li>
<li>The <strong>progress</strong>: how many days the project has progressed during the selected week, that is the difference between the selected week project status and the previous one;</li>
<li>The <strong>1D Value</strong> <strong>(Budget)</strong>: estimated daily production value, that is &ldquo;what is the expected value that must be produced for the project by day?&rdquo;. This is calculated by dividing the project&rsquo;s estimate by the project&rsquo;s budget days;</li>
<li>The <strong>1D Value (Actual)</strong>: actual daily production value, that is &ldquo;what is the value produced for the project by day?&rdquo;. This is calculated by dividing the project&rsquo;s production value by the project&rsquo;s worked days. This value is green if it&rsquo;s greater than <em>1D Value (Budget)</em>, red otherwise;</li>
<li>The <strong>external cost</strong>: project&rsquo;s external cost percentage on the total estimate. This is the same for each week of the project</li>
</ul>

<p>You can switch between month&rsquo;s week by using the selector placed at the top of this section.</p>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2018/02/22/production-value_weekly.png" alt="" /></p>

The information is based on the quantity of positive <a href="https://support.wethod.com/payroll/index/#employees">payrolls</a> within the shown timeframe. The forecast, which also considers the number of <a href="https://support.wethod.com/payroll/index/#placeholders">placeholders</a> in the current quarter/year, is represented with a dashed line compared to the past quarters/years. A headcount target can be added and edited from the widget’s options button.</li>
<li><strong>In &amp; Out</strong>: (in units) this chart shows the number of employees hired in your company (in green) or that left your company (in red) for each quarter of the current year, in the last 3 or 5 years. The forecast, which also considers the number of <a href="https://support.wethod.com/payroll/index/#placeholders">placeholders</a> in the current quarter/year, is represented in low opacity compared to the past quarters/years.</li>
<li><strong>Costs and revenues per employee</strong>: (monthly average, in K) this chart shows the monthly average <a href="https://support.wethod.com/external-costs/index">costs</a> and <a href="https://support.wethod.com/revenues/index">revenues</a> per employee. The average is calculated taking into account the amount of employees shown as headcount for the given period of time. The forecast, which also includes the current quarter/year, is represented with a dashed line compared to the past.</li>
<li><strong>Gender distribution</strong>: (in units) this chart shows the gender distribution in your company. Each team member can express their gender identity from the contact information section inside their <a href="https://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#profile">profile page</a>.

<li><strong>Age distribution</strong>: (in units) this chart shows the age distribution and its average trend in your company. To better digest this information, Wethod divides the population belonging to a given set of age ranges: less than 20 years old, 20-29, 30-39, 49-49, 50-59, and more than 60 years old. The current quarter/year is still considered as a forecast, therefore it is represented in low opacity compared to the past quarters/years.</li>

To add tags to a team member head to the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#team">Team settings</a>, choose a tag category name and add tag names to team members. The current quarter/year is still considered as a forecast, therefore it is represented in low opacity compared to the past quarters/years.</li>
<li><strong>Business units</strong>: (in units) this chart shows the business unit demographics of your team. The current quarter/year is still considered as a forecast, therefore it is represented in low opacity compared to the past quarters/years.</li>

<h2 id="time-off-manager">Time-off Manager</h2>

<p>Particular job order categories may be used to represent <strong>time off</strong>, that are hours spent out of work. Time off can come in different flavors:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vacation</strong>: the annual and usually paid time you get off work</li>
<li><strong>Leave</strong>: refers to time when you can go away from your job</li>
<li><strong>General</strong> if it does not need to be tracked in special ways</li>
</ul>

<p>Differences between &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; and &ldquo;leave&rdquo; time off are probably meaningful only in Italy where they&rsquo;re legally distinct items.</p>
