      <description>Overview All the data you insert in WETHOD are used to generate, weekly and automatically, a set of reports useful to monitor the projects&amp;rsquo; progress.
Project Report Each Monday, utilising data provided by Timesheet, Project Status and Budget, a Project Report is automatically created.
Budget Consumption / Project Status This section shows the budget consumption of the project, compared to its progress:
 If the project is above the diagonal: it&amp;rsquo;s using a lot of days but it&amp;rsquo;s progressing slowly than predictions based on budget; If the project is under the diagonal: it&amp;rsquo;s using few days but it&amp;rsquo;s progressing faster than predictions based on budget; If the project is on the diagonal: it&amp;rsquo;s planned and managed correctly.</description>
