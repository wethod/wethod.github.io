 Percentage of external costs;
 Category;
 Probability.
  Pipeline has three subsections: Basket, Projects and Programs.
Basket The Basket contains all the project’s opportunity that are not well-defined yet. You can see it as a place where to put all the ideas that you usually write on a notebook or on a Post-It.</description>

      <description>Overview The budget is the place where you try to define (for a project):
 How many people you need;
 Which experience level you need;
 Which tasks are needed to get the job done;
 Who will do what;
 The external costs;
 The selling price.
  Done? Now the budget must be approved by a supervisor and, once approved, the project manager can start planning and creating orders.</description>

      <description>Overview The planning is useful to look at teammates availability, allocate them for projects and check that you respect the budget quota.
You can plan a person by half-days: we think it&amp;rsquo;s not worth planning by more fine-grained amounts of time. If your tasks require less time, just group them!
Note
You cannot plan people for the current day: if you don&#39;t know what you have to do when you arrive at the office, how can you be productive?</description>

      <description>Overview WETHOD follows a weekly cycle: we think that a week is a good trade-off between the need to control the project&amp;rsquo;s progress as much as possible and the need to not burden the control activities.
Every Friday an e-mail will remind:
 Each project manager to compile the Project Status for its projects; Each collaborator to compile the Timesheet for the projects he worked on.   Timesheet At the end of each week, type in here the actual hours you&amp;rsquo;ve spent working on the projects you are involved in.</description>

      <description>Overview All the data you insert in WETHOD are used to generate, weekly and automatically, a set of reports useful to monitoring the projects&amp;rsquo; progress.
Project Report Each Monday, utilising data provided by Timesheet, Project Status and Budget, a Project Report is automatically created.
Budget Consumption / Project Status This section shows the budget consumption of the project, compared to its progress:
 If the project is above the diagonal: it&amp;rsquo;s using a lot of days but it&amp;rsquo;s progressing slowly than predictions based on budget;</description>

      <description>Absolute Project Progress This value indicates how much a project is advanced since its beginning. For example, a project with:
 Budget days: 200;
 Last project status: 40;
  Has an absolute project progress of: ( 200 - 40 ) / 200 * 100 = 80 % .
Budget Consumption This value indicates, for a project, the percentage of the budget days already used. This is calculated by comparing timesheet hours and budget days.</description>
