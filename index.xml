      <description>Overview WETHOD follows a weekly cycle: we think that a week is a good trade-off between the need to control the project&amp;rsquo;s progress as much as possible and the need to not burden the control activities.
Every Friday an e-mail will remind:
 Each project manager to compile the Project Status for its projects;
 Each collaborator to compile the Timesheet for the projects he worked on.
  Timesheet Remember to insert only the real worked hours, cheating isn&amp;rsquo;t useful to anybody.</description>

Project Report Each Monday, utilising data provided by Timesheet, Project Status and Budget, a Project Report is automatically created.
Budget Consumption / Project Status This section shows the budget consumption of the project, compared to its progress:
 If the project is above the diagonal: it&amp;rsquo;s using a lot of days but it&amp;rsquo;s progressing slowly than predictions based on budget; If the project is under the diagonal: it&amp;rsquo;s using few days but it&amp;rsquo;s progressing faster than predictions based on budget; If the project is on the diagonal: it&amp;rsquo;s planned and managed correctly.</description>

      <description>Overview Here you can see the value of your projects for each month of the current year.
The monthly distribution is achieved by looking at the production plan of every project, for example: if a project is evaluated 10 K with 3 K planned to be produced in January and 7 K planned to be produced in February, the value of this project will contribute with 3 K to the January&amp;rsquo;s revenues and with 7 K to February&amp;rsquo;s revenues.</description>

Note
For a completed project (that is a project with last project status equal to 0) orders&amp;rsquo; value is used instead of external costs. This way you can have a more accurate look at the costs implied in your projects.
 The monthly distribution is achieved by looking at the production plan of every project, for example: if a project has a value of 10 K with 3 K planned to be produced in January and 7 K planned to be produced in February, we can also say that you planned to invoice 30% in January and 70% in February.</description>

      <description>Absolute Project Progress This value indicates how much a project is advanced since its beginning. For example, a project with:
 Budget days: 200; Last project status: 40;  Has an absolute project progress of: ( 200 - 40 ) / 200 * 100 = 80 % .
Bluesky It represents the value you think is missing in order to reach an hypothetical overall value.
For example: if I have an actual value of 5 but I know that, in a particular moment in time, actual value will reach the final value of 7, then I can use a Bluesky of 2.</description>
