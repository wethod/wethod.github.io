      <description>Overview WETHOD follows a weekly cycle: we think that a week is a good trade-off between the need to control the project&amp;rsquo;s progress as much as possible and the need to not burden the control activities.
Every Friday an e-mail will remind:
 Each project manager to compile the Project Status for its projects;
 Each collaborator to compile the Timesheet for the projects he worked on.
  Timesheet Remember to insert only the real worked hours, cheating isn&amp;rsquo;t useful to anybody.</description>

      <description>Overview All the data you insert in WETHOD are used to generate, weekly and automatically, a set of reports useful to monitoring the projects&amp;rsquo; progress.
Project Report Each Monday, utilising data provided by Timesheet, Project Status and Budget, a Project Report is automatically created.
Budget Consumption / Project Status This section shows the budget consumption of the project, compared to its progress:
 If the project is above the diagonal: it&amp;rsquo;s using a lot of days but it&amp;rsquo;s progressing slowly than predictions based on budget; If the project is under the diagonal: it&amp;rsquo;s using few days but it&amp;rsquo;s progressing faster than predictions based on budget; If the project is on the diagonal: it&amp;rsquo;s planned and managed correctly.</description>

      <description>Absolute Project Progress This value indicates how much a project is advanced since its beginning. For example, a project with:
 Budget days: 200;
 Last project status: 40;
  Has an absolute project progress of: ( 200 - 40 ) / 200 * 100 = 80 % .
Bluesky It represents the value you think is missing in order to reach an hypothetical overall value.
For example: if I have an actual value of 5 but I know that, in a particular moment in time, actual value will reach the final value of 7, then I can use a Bluesky of 2.</description>
