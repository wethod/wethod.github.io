<h4 id="add">Add</h4>

<p>To add a client <a href="https://support.wethod.com/finance/index/#add-a-new-client">follow these steps</a>.</p>

<h4 id="edit">Edit</h4>

<p>To edit the information of a client open its company details panel, click the edit button make the necessary changes, and then click save. <img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/CRM/client company details edit.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="delete">Delete</h4>

<p>To delete a client open its company details panel, and then click the trash can icon. You&rsquo;ll see a pop-up asking if you&rsquo;re sure to proceed.</p>

<p>If the client <strong>doesn&rsquo;t have any projects assigned</strong> to them and has no associated contacts, simply click on the green &ldquo;<strong>Yes, delete</strong>&rdquo; button to proceed.<img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/CRM/delete a client - no details.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>If the client <strong>has projects assigned</strong> to them and/or associated contacts, after clicking the green &ldquo;Yes, delete&rdquo; button, you&rsquo;ll see another pop-up warning that you can&rsquo;t delete the client due to associated data.</p>

<p>You can choose you to <strong>migrate</strong> the associated data to another client; if this option suits your needs - for example, if you&rsquo;ve identified a duplicate client - select the customer to whom you want to transfer all existing projects in the &ldquo;choose new client&rdquo; bar (please note that the receiving customer profile must already exist; you cannot create a new one from this panel) and click &ldquo;<strong>Delete and Replace</strong>&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/delete a client- details.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>However, if you want to <strong>delete all projects and contacts</strong> related to a client, you must first <strong>manually delete</strong> these items before being able to delete the client.</p>

<h3 id="client-dashboard">Client Dashboard</h3>

<p>In the Client Details page, you&rsquo;ll discover a variety of charts that summaries the history between your client and you company.<img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2019/12/12/client-detail.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="the-revenue-clock-for-the-current-year-client">The revenue clock for the current year - Client</h4>

<p>This revenue clock is based only on the specific client data. It&rsquo;s like a <strong>visual progress tracker</strong>! Picture a round chart divided into three colors, showing different aspects of the client&rsquo;s revenue.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>gray</strong> <strong>part</strong> is like a <strong>countdown</strong>, telling you how many weeks are left in the year.</li>
<li>The <strong>blue part</strong> is about the <strong>value</strong> of <strong>ongoing opportunities and projects</strong> with the client. It&rsquo;s calculated based on how likely they are to succeed and their value.</li>
<li>The <strong>green part</strong> is the <strong>work you&rsquo;ve already done for the client</strong>, updated weekly by the project status added by the project managers.</li>
<li>In the middle is our <strong>revenue target for the year</strong>. You can set it in the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/revenues/index/#revenues-target">Revenue Target section</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/CRM/client Revenue Clock - crm.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="invoices-client">Invoices - Client</h4>

<p>The invoice widget in this page displays a list of invoices that need to be sent out for that specific client, following the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/pipeline/index/#invoice-plan">project&rsquo;s invoice plan</a>.</p>

<p>If an alert is marked in <strong>red</strong>, it&rsquo;s a <strong>high-priority</strong> task because the invoice should have been sent in the past. If it&rsquo;s <strong>yellow</strong>, it means the invoice is <strong>due for this month</strong> or the next one; if it has <strong>no color</strong> it means the invoice is planned for a <strong>future date</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/CRM/client invoices overview -crm.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="filter-your-data-view">Filter your data view</h4>

<p>The charts below typically show data for the current year, broken down into quarterly views. But if you&rsquo;d like, you can switch things up by using the selector at the top right of the insights to check out data from the past 3 or 5 years.</p>

<h4 id="revenues-client">Revenues - Client</h4>

<p>This chart presents a visual comparison of quarterly targets and production value for a client.</p>

<p>The <strong>yellow bars</strong> represent the <strong>revenue targets</strong> established for each quarter, providing a clear benchmark for expected performance. The <strong>blue histogram</strong> depicts the <strong>total value of the production plans</strong> for the client&rsquo;s projects.</p>

<p>For past and completed months, the blue bars indicate the actual production value, confirmed by the weekly project status done by the project managers. This means that for the quarters that are complete, the production plan figures match the actual revenue generated.</p>

<p>For the ongoing and future quarters, the blue bars are based on the estimated production plan of the client&rsquo;s projects. These estimates are projections that will be updated as more project statuses are confirmed.</p>

<p>The chart provides a snapshot of current and forecasted performance against targets, offering an at-a-glance indication of how closely the production aligns with goals throughout the year.</p>

<p>The chart&rsquo;s legend feature lets you tweak how you see things based on what you&rsquo;re checking out. Just click on &lsquo;Revenues&rsquo; or &lsquo;Target,&rsquo; and you can turn the blue bars on or off for the revenue or the yellow ones for the revenue targets. It makes the view more flexible, so you can focus on one set of data at a time, making it super handy for diving deep into the details or when you&rsquo;re showing the data to others.</p>

<h4 id="won-projects-value-client">Won projects&rsquo; value - Client</h4>

<p>This chart displays the value of projects won by quarter, representing the instances when the client have approved projects, which is a separate metric from when revenue is actually generated from production. This distinction is crucial because it separates the sales success from the operational execution.</p>

<p>It tracks the success of the sales team in securing projects. This is an indicator of market success and potential future revenue.</p>

<h4 id="sparkines">Sparkines</h4>

<p>This is series of five performance indicators, each one of them is represented by a sparkline graph that depicts the trend over selected period.</p>

<p>Sparklines are color-coded to emphasize trends:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Red</strong> indicates that the last value is worse than the first one.</li>
<li><strong>Blue</strong> suggests that the first and last values are the same.</li>
<li><strong>Green</strong> signifies that the last value is better than the first one.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="won-projects">Won Projects</h4>

<p>This metric shows the number of projects won (with 90% or 100% probability of success) by the company across the periods.</p>

<h4 id="proposals">Proposals</h4>

<p>Indicates the number of projects that reached a 90% probability of success (won) or dropped to a 0% probability (lost). [This indicates the number of proposals submitted to potential clients.]</p>

<h4 id="average-project-value">Average Project Value</h4>

<p>It represents the average economic size of all won projects.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-rate">Conversion Rate</h4>

<p>This shows the success rate of converting proposals into won projects.</p>

<h4 id="average-profitability">Average Profitability</h4>

<p>This metric displays the average profitability percentage of all won projects within the selected time range.</p>

<h4 id="won-projects-1">Won projects</h4>

<p>In this list you will find all your client projects with a 90% or 100% probability.</p>

<h4 id="lost-projects">Lost Projects</h4>

<p>In this list you will find all your client projects with 0% probability.</p>

<h4 id="outstanding-projects">Outstanding Projects</h4>

<p>In this list you will find all your client projects with a probability between 10% and 75%.</p>

<p>As the case shown above, if you see the message &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here! What about starting a new project?&rdquo;, it means there are no projects for that client in that particular status.</p>

<p>🌈 For the won/lost project you can see the &ldquo;Won/Lost Feedback&rdquo; feature when you enable the related job order category&rsquo;s flag in the company settings.</p>

<h4 id="contacts">Contacts</h4>

<p>At the bottom of the client details page, you&rsquo;ll find a summary of the client&rsquo;s contacts. Here, you&rsquo;ll see their names, roles, and email addresses.</p>

<h2 id="expenses">Expenses</h2>

<p><em>Projects &gt; Wallet &gt; Expenses</em></p>

<p>The expense reimbursement process allows employers to pay back employees who have spent their own money for business-related expenses. These types of reimbursable expenses tend to occur when employees travel for work, but can be associated with other activities related to their employment, including, for example, certain purchases of work-related supplies or tools.</p>

<p><img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2022/08/30/expenses-list.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>All expenses are listed with the following information at display:</p>

<ul>
<li>Job order category badge</li>
<li>Category of expense</li>
<li>Requested by</li>
<li>Project</li>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Notes</li>
<li>Reimbursement value (always expressed in master currency)</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on <a href="https://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#permissions">permission roles</a>, users can view, edit, delete their own expenses and/or others&rsquo; expenses.</p>

<p>Users with permission to edit others&rsquo; expenses can also change the owner of the expense when creating or updating it from the sidebar details.</p>

<h3 id="type-of-reimbursement">Type of reimbursement</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Flat-rate</strong>: whether the type of reimbursement is a fixed value (expressed in the reimbursement <em>value</em> field, required), regardless the value of the expense. <em>i.e. Acme Inc. refunds each employee 12 for a lunch. Mario, who works for Acme, had a business lunch and spent 24,65. Mario will be refunded 12 by Acme Inc.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mileage/Km</strong>: whether the type of reimbursement is a fixed value (expressed in the reimbursement <em>value</em> field, required) per mile or kilometer declared by the employee. <em>i.e. Acme Inc. refunds 0,40 for each km travelled. Mario, who works for Acme, made a business trip with his own car and travelled a total of 260km. Mario will be refunded 140 (260x0,40=140).</em></li>
<li><strong>Total</strong>: whether the employer refunds the whole expense declared by the employee. <em>i.e. Acme Inc. refunds the total cost of a taxi trip. Wendy, in her business travel for Acme,took a taxi from London Victoria train station to the City and spent 30. Wendy will be refunded 30.</em></li>
<li><strong>Total (max value)</strong>: whether the employer refunds the whole expense until a maximum refund value (expressed in the <em>reimbursement value</em> field, required) is reached. <em>i.e. Acme Inc. refunds the total cost of a dinner up to 30. Britney, an account manager at Acme, had a business dinner with her clients  and spent 250. Britney will be refunded 30.</em></li>
<li><strong>Quantity</strong>: whether the employer refunds a fixed value per unit. <em>i.e. Acme Inc. refunds the 0,10 for each marker bought by an employee. Jason, a UX designer at Acme, bought 20 markers for a design workshop he conducted with a client. Jason will be refunded 2.</em></li>
