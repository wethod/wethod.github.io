      <description>Overview In this section, you can see the yearly external cost distribution of all your projects. The monthly external cost is calculated as follow:
Ordered value is distributed on each month based on the period they cover, in particular:
 Orders value follow the &amp;ldquo;Period of Supply&amp;rdquo;, for example: an Order of 3k with the period from January to June will weigh 500 each month from January to June. Travels value follows the departure and return date of each Travel (if the travel is a one-way trip all costs will go on the departure date).</description>
