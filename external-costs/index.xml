      <description>Overview Here you can see the external costs listed in your projects&amp;rsquo; budget for each month of the current year.
The monthly distribution is achieved by looking at the invoice plan of every project, for example: if a project has a value of 10 K with 3 K planned to be invoiced in January and 7 K planned to be invoiced in February, we can also say that you planned to invoice the 30% in January and the 70% in February.</description>
