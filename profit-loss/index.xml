      <description>Overview This page provides an overview of the budgetary slippages between a company&amp;rsquo;s projected revenues and its expenses, as well as its budget target over a given period of time. The three columns budget, forecast 1 and forecast 2 can be used to set the company&amp;rsquo;s financial goals for each quarter of the year.
The column budget in the revenues row is used to set the revenues&amp;rsquo; target for the company, which is used in the widget Revenue Clock and in the report Production Value.</description>
