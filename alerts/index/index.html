			<h1>Alerts </h1>
			
			

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>An alert is an inconsistency regarding the user. Each alert has a priority (indicated by its color):</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Red</em> alerts have an high priority and must be solved as soon as possible;</li>
<li><em>Yellow</em> alerts have a low priority and can be seen more as advices;</li>
<li><em>Blue</em> alerts are reminders of minor fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Positioning the cursor over an alert will display a description of the problem.</p>

<p>Some alerts depends on parameters that you can customize using the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#alerts-engine">Alerts Engine</a>.</p>

<h3 id="unsent-order">Unsent Order</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the project manager who has created the order which need to be sent.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Just send all the waiting orders.</p>

<h3 id="unsent-invoice">Unsent Invoice</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the project manager who has created the invoice which need to be sent.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Just send all the waiting invoices.</p>

<h3 id="expiring-opportunity">Expiring Opportunity</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the project manager who have created an opportunity that&rsquo;s expiring in 3 days.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Transform the opportunity into a project by clicking on the &ldquo;+ PROJECT&rdquo;  button placed near the opportunity itself. Otherwise, if the opportunity isn&rsquo;t ready to became a project, just change the date in the opportunity&rsquo;s &ldquo;Next Step&rdquo; field.</p>

<h3 id="expired-opportunity">Expired Opportunity</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the project manager who created an opportunity that&rsquo;s already expired.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Transform the opportunity into a project by clicking on the &ldquo;+ PROJECT&rdquo;  button placed near the opportunity itself. Otherwise, if the opportunity isn&rsquo;t ready to became a project, just change the date in the opportunity&rsquo;s &ldquo;Next Step&rdquo; field.</p>

<h3 id="intercompany-invitation-not-sent">Intercompany invitation not sent</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the project manager who created an intercompany task and did not send an invitation to a supplier that will be responsible for the task.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Send an invitation to a supplier in your group that will be in charge of the task.</p>

<h3 id="intercompany-invitation-pending">Intercompany invitation pending</h3>

<p>This alert appears on your desk if you have not yet accepted an invitation to collaborate in an intercompany project.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Link an existing project in your company with the intercompany task you were invited to take responsibility for.</p>

<h3 id="project-probability-invoice-plan">Project Probability / Invoice Plan</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the project manager of a project which has:</p>

<ul>
<li>An <a href="https://support.wethod.com/pipeline/index/#invoice-plan">invoice plan</a> manually set;</li>
<li>A probability lower than 90</li>
</ul>

<p>A project is considered active when its probability reaches 90%, only when this happens makes sense to think about creating a invoice plan.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Leave the invoice plan set to &ldquo;Auto&rdquo; until your project hits the 90% of probability.</p>

<h3 id="budget-submitted">Budget Submitted</h3>

<p>This alert is shown if you have the permission to approve budgets and there&rsquo;s a budget waiting for approval.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Approve the waiting budget.</p>

<h3 id="budget-consumption-too-fast">Budget Consumption Too Fast</h3>

<p>This alert is shown if you’re the manager of a project where the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/##budget-consumption">budget consumption</a> is more than 15% greater than the project&rsquo;s <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#absolute-project-progress">progress</a>.</p>

<img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2017/08/28/budget_cons_too_fast.png" class="figure--center"></img>

<p>This means you&rsquo;re consuming too many days and, if you don&rsquo;t fix this situation, you will be soon run out of budget days.
This can have two main causes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Somebody has done something wrong with the timesheet;</li>
<li>The project manager has done an incorrect project status.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Talk to your teammates in order to find why timesheets and project status differ so much. Once you&rsquo;ve find the problem, edit the timesheet or the project status which is causing it.</p>

<h3 id="budget-consumption-too-slow">Budget Consumption Too Slow</h3>

<p>This alert is shown if you&rsquo;re manager of a project where the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/reports/index/#budget-consumption">budget consumption</a> is more than 15% lower than the project&rsquo;s <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#absolute-project-progress">progress</a>.</p>

<img src="https://support.wethod.com/uploads/2017/08/28/budget_cons_too_slow.png" class="figure--center"></img>

<p>This means you&rsquo;ve planned too many days and, if you don&rsquo;t fix this situation, you will reach the end of the project with a lot of budget days left.
This can have two main causes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Somebody has done some wrong timesheet;</li>
<li>The project manager has done an incorrect project status.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Talk to your teammates in order to find why timesheets and project status differ so much. Once you&rsquo;ve find the problem, edit the timesheet or the project status which is causing it.</p>

<h3 id="project-status-archived">Project Status / Archived</h3>

<p>This alert is shown if you&rsquo;re manager of a finished project which isn&rsquo;t already been archived.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Archive your projects when their project status reach 0.</p>

<h3 id="project-probability-missing-budget">Project Probability / Missing Budget</h3>

<p>This alert is shown if you&rsquo;re manager of a project with probability greater than 50% and with budget missing.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Lower the probability, provide a budget or ask your supervisor to approve the budget.</p>

<h3 id="project-probability-budget-status">Project Probability / Budget Status</h3>

<p>This alert is shown if you&rsquo;re manager of a project with probability greater than 50% and with a budget still in draft.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Lower the probability or ask your supervisor to approve the budget.</p>

<h3 id="planning-or-timesheet-but-probability-is-too-low">Planning Or Timesheet But Probability Is Too Low</h3>

<p>This alert is shown if you&rsquo;re manager of a project with probability lower than 90% but which already has planning and/or timesheets assigned.</p>

<p>Remember that a project is considered active only if it has a probability greater or equal to 90%.
For a project that is not active yet, there&rsquo;s no need to plan resources or to register a timesheet.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Increase project&rsquo;s probability or delete plannend hours and timesheets for the project itself.</p>

<h3 id="planning-project-status">Planning &gt; Project Status</h3>

<p>This alert is shown if you&rsquo;re manager of a project for which are planned (in the future) more days than the last project status days. What&rsquo;s the meaning of requiring more resources than what you really need?</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Make project&rsquo;s planning and last project status to be consistent each other.</p>

<h3 id="client-po">Client PO</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the project manager if one of the following situations happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project has probability of 100% and there isn&rsquo;t a Purchase Order set for the project</li>
<li>Project has some invoices but there isn&rsquo;t a Purchase Order set for the project</li>
<li>A Purchase Order is set for the project despite its probability is lower than 100%</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Add a PO once a project reach 100% of probability, add invoices only to projects that already have a PO.</p>

<h3 id="project-start">Project Start</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the project manager if one of the following situations happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>A project is started but its probability is lower than 90%</li>
<li>A project is going to start during the current month but its probability is lower than 75%</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember: a project is considered started if it has a start date in the past or if someone has submitted timesheets for it.</p>

<p>*How to solve it?* If a project is going to start during the current month, increase its probability to 90%. Change the start date otherwise.</p>

<h3 id="project-status">Project Status</h3>

<p>This alert is shown if you&rsquo;re manager and you&rsquo;ve forgot to update a project&rsquo;s status in the last two weeks.
A project status is required for a given week only if at least a timesheet has been submitted for that week.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Provide the missing project statuses.</p>

<h3 id="timesheet">Timesheet</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to employees who, during the last weeks, submitted timesheet amount lower than the target amount selected from the <a href="https://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#alerts-engine">Alerts Engine</a> section.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Provide the missing timesheets.</p>

<h3 id="project-duration-timesheet">Project Duration / Timesheet</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the manager of a project which has some timesheets done before the start date or after the end date.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Delete the timesheets done before the start date or after the end date. Otherwise extend the project duration *so it will include* all the project status done.</p>

<h3 id="invoice-plan-budget-final-net-price">Invoice Plan / Budget Final Net Price</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the manager of a project if the following situations happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>The invoice plan is set as manual</li>
<li>Invoice plan&rsquo;s total amount and final net price  mismatch</li>
</ul>

<p>This can happen when you edit a budget after setting invoice plan as manual.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Make invoice plan and final net price match.</p>

<h3 id="job-order-project-probability">Job Order / Project Probability</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the manager of a project if one of the following situations happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>The probability is greater than 90% but the project hasn&rsquo;t a job order</li>
<li>The probability si lower than 90% and the project has a job order</li>
</ul>

<p>Remind: only active projects (which means projects with a probability greater or equal to 90%) must have a <a href="https://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#job-order">job order</a></p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Assign job order only to active projects.</p>

<h3 id="planning-project-end">Planning / Project End</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the manager of a project which has planned even more people to the project, even after the end date.</p>

<p>In other words: the project is over, you have no reason to plan people on it.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Remove planned people assigned to ended projects.</p>

<h3 id="planning-budget-status">Planning / Budget Status</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the manager of a project which has planned future resources but hasn&rsquo;t an approved <a href="https://support.wethod.com/budget/index/#budget">budget</a></p>

<p>The planned resources say that the project is active but the budget is not approved, so the alert will remind you to approve it as soon as possible.You cannot plan resources if you haven’t got a budget  which gives you the right to do it.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> Ask your supervisor to approve the budget.</p>

<h3 id="non-chargeable-budget-final-net-price">Non Chargeable / Budget Final Net Price</h3>

<p>This alert is shown to the manager of a non chargeable project which has a final net price greater than zero. This is a paradox because non chargeable project can&rsquo;t have revenues by definition.</p>

<p><em>How to solve it?</em> If the project is really non chargeable, set its final net price to zero. Otherwise change the project&rsquo;s type to a chargeable one.</p>
