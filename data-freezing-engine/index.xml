      <description>Overview Data freezing is a concept and functionality that spans most sections of the system. At its core, it ensures the accuracy and reliability of historical data over time, preserving information integrity. This functionality is particularly useful for companies conducting quarterly or semi-annual financial statements, as it guarantees that Wethod continues to respect the closing data.
Data that requires freezing typically has an economic or financial impact on the Profit and Loss (P&amp;amp;L) statement.</description>
